# LocalStorage_To-doList
 
#Todo List Project

###This is a simple Todo List application that allows users to manage tasks efficiently. The application supports adding, deleting, and clearing tasks. All tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring that they persist even after a page refresh.

## Features:
- **Add Tasks**: Users can input text through a text box, and each task is added as a list item (**<li>**) to the page.
- **Local Storage**: All items are stored in the browserâ€™s **local storage**, ensuring persistence between sessions.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can select and delete a specific item from both the list and local storage.
- **Clear All Tasks**: The "Clear" button removes all items from the list and clears them from local storage.
